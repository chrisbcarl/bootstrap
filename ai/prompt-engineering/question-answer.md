# Question

Why is the sky blue?

# Answer

The sky is blue because water particles in the air refract light with blue wavelengths.

### Refined answer

The sky appears blue because molecules in Earth’s atmosphere scatter shorter-wavelength sunlight (blue/violet) much more strongly than longer-wavelength light. This process is Rayleigh scattering; violet is scattered even more, but the sky looks blue mainly because human vision is less sensitive to violet and some violet light is absorbed in the upper atmosphere.

### Changes made

1. Replaced “water particles … refract light” with **molecular scattering (Rayleigh scattering)** as the primary mechanism.
2. Corrected the claim that **refraction** explains the blue sky; refraction is not the dominant effect here.
3. Added why the sky is **blue rather than violet** (human spectral sensitivity + some atmospheric absorption).

### Corrected Answer

The sky is blue due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**. As sunlight reaches the atmosphere, it is scattered in all directions by the gases and particles in the air. Blue light travels as shorter, smaller waves and is scattered much more strongly by gas molecules (primarily nitrogen and oxygen) than longer wavelengths like red light. This scattered blue light reaches our eyes from all parts of the sky.

### List of Changes

* **Correction of Mechanism:** Changed the physical process from **refraction** (bending of light) to **scattering** (deflection of light in random directions).
* **Correction of Agent:** Changed the primary cause from **water particles** to **gas molecules** (nitrogen and oxygen). Water droplets generally cause Mie scattering (which makes clouds look white), whereas Rayleigh scattering by smaller gas molecules causes the blue color.
* **Added Context:** Specified that shorter wavelengths (blue) scatter more easily than longer wavelengths.
